## PROGRAM LEDGER / PLANNING PROGRESS

**Document ID:** CSIA-LEDGER-001
**Version:** 0.1
**Constitutional role:** Per Constitution v0.2 §G, this ledger is the **sole authoritative record** of the current authorized next step and program state. "NEXT" statements in other CSIA documents are non-authoritative pointers.

## Program status

| Artifact | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IACER plan | WRITTEN (v1) | Mission charter; sound; no critical defects |
| Constitution v0.1 | SUPERSEDED (preserved) | 7 critical issues found in review; not ratifiable |
| Constitutional review v0.1 | COMPLETE | 30 issues: 7 CRITICAL / 13 MAJOR / 10 MINOR |
| Constitution v0.2 | DRAFT — NOT RATIFIED | All CR-01..CR-07 addressed; awaits operator D1 |
| Book 0 ratification packet v0.1 | FROZEN_FOR_REVIEW | READY_FOR_OPERATOR_RATIFICATION = TRUE; decisions D1–D6 |
| Book 1 detailed plan v0.1 | PLANNED — FROZEN_FOR_REVIEW | Blocs 1A–1D fully contracted; planning only |
| Book 1 pilot stress matrix v0.1 | COMPLETE (planning) | 7 pilots; 0 structural failures; 12 amendment candidates; R-1A-5 open |
| Books 2–9 | NOT STARTED | Roadmap v0.1 only |
| Implementation | NOT AUTHORIZED | BLOC_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORITY = FALSE |

## Planning phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Constitutional review + v0.2 | COMPLETE (not ratified) |
| Phase 2 — Book 0 ratification packet | COMPLETE (awaiting operator) |
| Phase 3 — Book 1 detailed plan | COMPLETE |
| Phase 4 — Pilot ontology stress set | COMPLETE |
| Phase 5 — This ledger | COMPLETE |

All prior planning docs (IACER, Constitution v0.1, Roadmap v0.1) preserved unmodified.

## Open operator decisions (consolidated)

| ID | Decision | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| D1–D6 | Book 0 packet decisions (constitution ratification + 5 confirmations) | YES — for Book 0 closure and Book 1 ratification path |
| R-1A-5 | IBC voucher representation (CHANNEL_REPRESENTATIVE deployment status vs WRAPS+mechanism) | For Bloc 1A sealing |
| R-1A-1..4, R-1B-1..4, R-1C-1..4, R-1D-1..4 | Bloc review points (ratify at bloc review, after Book 0) | For bloc exit gates |
| E-1..E-13 | Stress-matrix amendment candidates (fold into bloc plans or Constitution amendments as noted) | Fold before bloc sealing |
| D7 | Capital Field reconciliation | Before Book 5 planning only |
| D8 | CSIA↔Sensor shared-seam ownership | Before Book 8 planning only |

## Constitutional blockers

```text
CRITICAL BLOCKERS REMAINING = 0 (in text)
The only remaining dependency is operator ratification itself:
  - D1..D6 (Book 0 packet) — must precede program ratification
  - R-1A-5 must be decided before Bloc 1A is sealed
No critical architectural defects remain open.
```

## Book 1 readiness

```text
BOOK_1_PLANNING            = COMPLETE (v0.1, all four blocs contracted)
BOOK_1_RATIFICATION_PATH   = D1..D6 operator decisions
                             -> Book 0 RATIFIED
                             -> bloc review points R-1A..R-1D + R-1A-5
                             -> fold amendment candidates E-1..E-13
                             -> Bloc Ratification Records per Constitution 34.1
BOOK_1_IMPLEMENTATION      = NOT AUTHORIZED
```

## NEXT (authoritative pointer)

```text
NEXT = OPERATOR: review and decide D1-D6 in CSIA_BOOK_0_RATIFICATION_PACKET.md
THEN = fold stress-matrix amendment candidates E-1..E-13 into bloc plans
THEN = bloc review cycle R-1A..R-1D (incl. R-1A-5)
THEN = Book 0 + Book 1 bloc ratification records (Constitution 34.1)
THEN = operator authorization decision for Book 1 implementation
STOP = no Book 2 planning is authorized by this session's mandate beyond
       this point; this ledger is the only next-step authority (Constitution G)
```
