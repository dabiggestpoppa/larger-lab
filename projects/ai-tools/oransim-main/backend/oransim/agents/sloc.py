"""SLOC — Sparse LLM Oracle Calibration.

Core IP of Oransim. Uses stratified sampling theory (Kish 1965) plus a
1/√N heuristic decay curve (the canonical central-limit shape, **not** a
derived PAC-Bayes bound) to let O(√N) LLM oracles represent a population
of N statistical agents.

Empirical target (curve, not a proof):
   | ĈSLOC − C_population | ≈ 0.30 / √N_anchors

The 0.30/√N shape is the target we validate against on backtests — it is
the same curve used in the Embedding Bus scaling-law widget. A formal
PAC-Bayes bound would require plugging in the posterior / prior KL term;
we do not claim one.

Under the hood: KNN coreset partition → per-anchor territory → log-weighted
calibration factor. This module re-exports the implementation from
`calibration.py` with Oransim-official naming.
