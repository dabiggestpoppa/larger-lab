### Recent Activity
#### 🟡 [AS] 2026-05-16 01:00:00Z — Book 2 Integration: Phase 3-5 Updated Architecture
- Read and analyzed updated Phase 3-5 plans (Book 2 integration)
- Updated `srra-oph-build` skill to v2 with overlap-first architecture
- Created new component stubs:
  - `active_collar_fields.py` — Active collar fields (edges as computation)
  - `local_consensus.py` — Local consensus engines (consensus != sync)
  - `capability_fields.py` — Capability fields (tools as topology regions)
  - `trajectory_fields.py` — Trajectory reconstruction fields (identity as trajectory)
- Created design docs: `phase4_design.md`, `phase5_design.md`
- Updated `__init__.py` with all new exports
- Updated CODEMAP.md with Book 2 architecture diagrams
- **Key architectural shifts documented:**
  - Phase 3: Overlap collars are continuity engine (not observer nodes)
  - Phase 4: Tools are capability fields (not isolated endpoints)
  - Phase 5: Identity is reconstructable trajectory (not persistent state)

#### 🟡 [AS] 2026-05-16 02:00:00Z — Cron-Style Monitoring Active
- All tests passing: Phase 2 (7/7), Phase 3 (4/4), Book 2 (6/6) = 17/17 total
- Resource assessment complete: 8/12 repos approved for integration
- Tasks delegated to OC and HR via team-chat.md
- Cron check script created at `tools/as-cron-check.py`
- **Current blockers**: None — all systems green
- **Next check**: Monitor OC/HR progress on delegated tasks

- Updated `.agent-tags.json` — HR → OC2
- Updated `progress-sync.py` — OC2 added to AGENTS + CLI choices
- Updated `team-chat.md` — OC2 online, Phase 6 tasks cleaned up, Phase 8 planning
- Updated `AGENTS.md` — phase status → Phase 8
- Updated `KEYS.md` — OC1 + OC2 bot tokens documented
- Created startup shortcut `OpenClaw 2 Gateway.cmd` for auto-start
- Discord channel config deferred (schema validation issue — Telegram working)
- All 38 tests still passing ✅
- **Next:** Add Discord config, implement Phase 8 components (Sovereignty Economics, Probabilistic Self-Models, MSR Compression)
- [ ] Prepare Phase 4 component stubs based on resource assessment
- [ ] Run cron check every 30min while stepping away
- [ ] Review Phase 2 test results
- [ ] Monitor team progress files
