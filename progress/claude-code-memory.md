# Build Notes — Key Themes, Reason, and Aim

> **Purpose:** Before any agent works, they read this file to understand the core principles, avoid known errors, and stay aligned.
> **Updated by:** CC2 (filling in for CC1 during 72h test)

## 1. CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE

**Key Theme:** ONE system, not many.

**Reason:** The project has a history of fragmenting into separate "systems" (SRRA, OPH, OCE, chaos engine, semantic tests, etc.) that don't communicate. The user explicitly corrected this: SRRA+OPH is the runtime substrate, OCE is the singular observational interface. Everything else is a capability layer, not a separate app.

**Aim:** Every new component must answer: "Does this deepen the runtime substrate, or does it expose the substrate through OCE?" If neither, it shouldn't be built yet.

---

## 2. OBSERVER ≠ GENERIC LLM

**Key Theme:** The primary observer is a continuity abstraction layer, not an LLM.

**Reason:** Earlier phases treated observers as generic agents. The corrected architecture distinguishes: the observer is a persistent, stateful, system-aware continuity interface. LLMs (OpenRouter models) are modular cognition sources that the observer orchestrates.

**Aim:** When building observer-related code, ask: "Is this maintaining continuity state, or is this just calling an LLM?" The former is core. The latter is a tool.

---

## 3. RUNTIME TOPOLOGY > STATIC STRUCTURE

**Key Theme:** The real topology exists at runtime, not in inheritance structure.

**Reason:** PM2's experiments proved that AST/import/class structures don't reveal operational reality. Runtime interaction is the actual graph.

**Aim:** All topology work must capture runtime edges (who talks to whom, when, how often), not just static code structure.

---

## 4. CONTINUITY > FEATURES

**Key Theme:** This phase is operational validation, not feature development.

**Reason:** The user explicitly stated: "No major abstractions. No large architectura

## Chaos Test Crashes

**2026-05-23 | OWL | Chaos test keeps crashing at higher amplification**
- **Symptom:** Process exits with code 1 during full_chaos scenario at amp ~3.0x
- **Root Cause:** Recovery timeout exceeded. At amp 3.0, event_flood duration = 360s, combined with router_failure (103s) and websocket_loss (90s) — too many concurrent long-running chaos events.
- **Resolution:** Internal auto-restart with consecutive crash limit (5) added. Test completes 4/5 cycles.
- **Lesson:** Recovery timeout must scale with number of concurrent injections, not just amplification.

**2026-05-23 | OWL | Duplicate chaos test instances running simultaneously**
- **Symptom:** Two chaos test processes writing to same trace log, causing interleaved entries
- **Root Cause:** Auto-restart wrapper spawned new subprocess before old one fully cleaned up its daemon threads
- **Resolution:** Kill all chaos-related processes before restarting. Use PID whitelist.
- **Lesson:** Always check for existing processes before spawning new ones. Use `Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like '*chaos*' }`.

**2026-05-23 | OWL | Trace log FileNotFoundError**
- **Symptom:** `log_trace` fails with FileNotFoundError for stability/chaos_20x_trace.log
- **Root Cause:** Relative path `Path("stability/...")` depends on CWD. When CWD changes, the path breaks.
- **Resolution:** Changed to absolute paths based on `Path(__file__).parent`. Also added `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` before every write.
- **Lesson:** Always use absolute paths based on script location, never relative paths for file I/O.

## Singleton Data Persistence

**2026-05-24 | OWL | Tufte renderers show empty data despite feeding data to singleton**
