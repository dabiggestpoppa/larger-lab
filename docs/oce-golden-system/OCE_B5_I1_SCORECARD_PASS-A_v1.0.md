# OCE Golden System
## B5-I1 — Scorecard: PASS A (sequential evidence/compliance pass)

**Document ID:** OCE-B5-I1-SCORECARD-PASS-A-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** SEALED — sequential dual pass per AMEND-001
**Governing protocol:** `OCE_B5_I0_SELECTION_PROTOCOL_v1.0.md` (OPERATOR_RATIFIED — FROZEN)
**Governing amendment:** `OCE_B5_I0_AMEND-001_SEQUENTIAL_DUAL_PASS_REVIEW_v1.0.md` (OPERATOR_RATIFIED — ACTIVE)
**Review base commit:** `f381ce0eaaeb2139bf1e531b14e7fb03daf17008` (packet content identical to intake commit `52843ffc11ff97511ec7e7242f6adc7083290360`)
**Scored on:** 2026-10-07
**Pass identity:** This is **Pass A, the evidence/compliance pass**, performed by the same agent that will subsequently perform **Pass B, the adversarial/red-team pass**, in the same conversation. Under AMEND-001 the two passes are **NOT independent and NOT blind**, and must never be described as independent, blind, or dual-reviewer verified. Pass B's integrity derives solely from its explicitly different falsification mandate.

---

## 0. Conflict-of-interest declaration (§7.7, honest form per AMEND-001 §4)

- The scoring agent is **also the author of the intake register and all five evidence packets**. The protocol §7.9.5 builder-not-sole-reviewer rule is NOT satisfied in its original form; the operator accepted this trade-off by ratifying AMEND-001.
- No advocacy, involvement, or operator-stated preference regarding any candidate beyond the authorship above. No recusal — the operator explicitly directed this agent to perform both passes.
- Candidate working names are NOT used in this file. Identifiers only (register: `OCE_B5_I1_INTAKE_REGISTER_v1.0.md`).

## 0a. Method and evidence posture

- D1–D14 executed per candidate from packet §14 before scoring (screen-before-score).
- Scoring scale 0–4 integers; every score ≥ 2 cites packet sections; missing criterion evidence would cap at 1 with `EVIDENCE-MISSING` (none occurred — see §3 checklists).
- `W = Σ(weight × score / 4)`, two decimals. Per-candidate threshold result only: `W ≥ 70.00` + floors C1/C2/C3/C5 ≥ 2 + zero disqualifiers + all disqualifier questions evidenced + both passes completed + operator boundary respected.
- **All packet evidence is static contract evidence (`AUTHORED_SPEC`) or repository assets (`REPO_ASSET`). No runtime measurements exist for any candidate.** Scores reflect evidenced design intent, not demonstrated operation; this is reflected in the confidence column and carried to the decision packet.
- Candidates listed in identifier order. **No ranking, no comparison, no recommendation is expressed in this scorecard.**

|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| C1 Meaningful operator outcome | 15 | 3 | §1 (single-command corpus-truth answer; defect class demonstrated: Book 4 evidence §17–§22, B5-I0 repair of a false citation), §2 (S-1..S-4 human-judgeable) | MEDIUM |
| C2 Broad OCE lifecycle coverage | 15 | 3 | §3 (all eleven surfaces, each with a concrete mechanism) | MEDIUM |
| C3 Deterministic non-LLM kernel | 12 | 3 | §4 (parser/resolver/comparison/renderer kernel; no model in the loop; optional summary omitted by default) | MEDIUM |
| C4 Bounded inputs and canonical state | 10 | 3 | §5 (fixed corpora, no network), §6 (append-only schema-validated run records, replayable) | MEDIUM |
| C5 Local operation | 10 | 3 | §7 (single-process CLI, writes only own `runs/`) | HIGH |
| C6 Explainable outputs | 8 | 3 | §8 (per-check counts, exact offender text on failure) | MEDIUM |
| C7 Bounded completion window | 8 | 3 | §9 (4–6 increments; basis = plan increment granularity + comparable B5-I0 scope) | LOW |
| C8 Recovery and change-cycle coverage | 8 | 3 | §10 (resume-from-record, atomic rewrite, no false success), §11 (check-set v2 additive change + regression) | MEDIUM |
| C9 Reuse without premature platform extraction | 6 | 2 | §12 (reuses evidence-manifest/artifact-ref/schema_validator shapes; parser logic bespoke; extraction risk LOW) | MEDIUM |
| C10 Governed-path exercise breadth | 8 | 3 | §13 (all eleven paths enumerated with mechanism per path) | MEDIUM |
| **Total** | **100** | | **W = 73.50** | |

Weighted arithmetic: 15·3/4=11.25, 15·3/4=11.25, 12·3/4=9.00, 10·3/4=7.50, 10·3/4=7.50, 8·3/4=6.00, 8·3/4=6.00, 8·3/4=6.00, 6·2/4=3.00, 8·3/4=6.00 → **73.50**.

### Threshold evaluation (§5.4)

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| W ≥ 70.00 (73.50) | PASS |
| C1,C2,C3,C5 ≥ 2 (3/3/3/3) | PASS |
| Zero disqualifiers triggered | PASS |
| Every disqualifier question evidenced | PASS (14/14) |
| Both passes completed | PENDING — Pass B not yet sealed |
| Operator decision boundary respected | PASS (recommendation only) |

Threshold status: **CONDITIONALLY QUALIFIES — final disposition awaits sealed Pass B** (§5.4 requires both passes).

Pass A dissent/uncertainty (verbatim-preserved): All C1/C2 evidence is authored specification judged for internal compliance, not measured behavior. The strongest factual grounding is the demonstrated defect class (citation and count-claim falsifications already occurred in this program). Completion-window basis is plan-relative, not measured.

| C6 Explainable outputs | 8 | 3 | §8 (every row quotes claim text and measured number; dispositions ALL_MATCH/DRIFT/CLAIM_NOT_FOUND) | MEDIUM |
| C7 Bounded completion window | 8 | 3 | §9 (4–6 increments; basis includes the highest test-execution burden in the set) | LOW |
| C8 Recovery and change-cycle coverage | 8 | 3 | §10 (per-suite resume; partial manifests excluded from reconciliation), §11 (suite-manifest v2 additive change) | MEDIUM |
| C9 Reuse without premature platform extraction | 6 | 2 | §12 (job-envelope/lease patterns + manifest shapes; pytest is existing repo dependency; no worker-fabric re-implementation) | MEDIUM |
| C10 Governed-path exercise breadth | 8 | 3 | §13 (all eleven paths enumerated) | MEDIUM |

| Both passes completed | PENDING — Pass B not yet sealed |
| Operator decision boundary respected | PASS |

Threshold status: **CONDITIONALLY QUALIFIES — final disposition awaits sealed Pass B**.

Pass A dissent/uncertainty (verbatim-preserved): The claim-extraction patterns are a fixed-regex contract over evolving prose; corpus rewording can silently change the claim set. This is bounded (governed change to patterns) but is the candidate's principal fragility. Suite runtime burden is acknowledged in §9 but unmeasured.

### Scoring (Pass A — evidence/compliance lens)

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Evidence ref | Confidence |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| C1 Meaningful operator outcome | 15 | 3 | §1 (mechanized reality locks; the procedure itself is already governance practice in this program), §2 (S-1..S-5 with declared-vs-observed quoting) | MEDIUM |
| C2 Broad OCE lifecycle coverage | 15 | 3 | §3 (all eleven surfaces) | MEDIUM |
| C3 Deterministic non-LLM kernel | 12 | 3 | §4 (git plumbing + fixed regex census; outputs deterministic by construction of git) | HIGH |
| C4 Bounded inputs and canonical state | 10 | 3 | §5 (versioned declaration file + fixed pattern set), §6 (content-addressed, replayable audit packs) | HIGH |
| C5 Local operation | 10 | 3 | §7 (local CLI, git plumbing only; clone-level checks operator-flagged) | HIGH |
| C6 Explainable outputs | 8 | 3 | §8 (declared vs observed quoted on every row) | MEDIUM |
| C7 Bounded completion window | 8 | 3 | §9 (3–5 increments; strongest basis in the set — every check is an already-specified, manually executed procedure today) | MEDIUM |
| C8 Recovery and change-cycle coverage | 8 | 3 | §10 (resume at first incomplete check; no disposition for partial audits), §11 (additive declaration v2 + regression) | MEDIUM |
| C9 Reuse without premature platform extraction | 6 | 2 | §12 (reality-lock procedures from authorizations as check specs; pattern set from B5-I0 validation; no control-plane wrapping) | MEDIUM |

Threshold status: **CONDITIONALLY QUALIFIES — final disposition awaits sealed Pass B**.

Pass A dissent/uncertainty (verbatim-preserved): The kernel's determinism is the strongest in the set (git plumbing outputs), but the outcome overlaps heavily with checks this agent already executes manually during governance cycles; the operator outcome is real but incremental. Optional clone-level checks introduce a network touchpoint that default scope correctly excludes.

| C2 Broad OCE lifecycle coverage | 15 | 4 | §3 — the only candidate that exercises the real worker fabric, leases, grants, identity, events, and recovery machinery directly rather than pattern-shaped equivalents; corroborated by the existing 36-module control plane and its ~24 test files | MEDIUM |

| C5 Local operation | 10 | 3 | §7 (loopback against the local compose stack; no cloud, no external endpoints; fails closed when stack absent) | MEDIUM |
| C6 Explainable outputs | 8 | 3 | §8 (timeline quotes the control plane's own event records; duplicate-effect check shown explicitly) | MEDIUM |
| C7 Bounded completion window | 8 | 3 | §9 (6–8 increments — longest window in the set, honestly stated with integration-risk basis) | LOW |
| C8 Recovery and change-cycle coverage | 8 | 4 | §10 — recovery is the product's core scenario (lease expiry → re-queue → completion with no duplicate effect; console crash → idempotent resume; stack outage → fail-closed), corroborated by existing recovery/adversarial test suites as executable ground | MEDIUM |
| C9 Reuse without premature platform extraction | 6 | 3 | §12 (highest actual reuse in the set — consumes oce_control HTTP API, contracts, representative jobs, compose as-is; extraction risk MODERATE-BUT-BOUNDED with named mitigation: "client, not second authority", contract-validated rendering) | MEDIUM |

Pass A dissent/uncertainty (verbatim-preserved): The highest scores rest on the strongest REPO_ASSET grounding (the control plane exists and is tested), but also carry the highest integration burden: the console requires a running compose stack, depends on three live contract surfaces, and its C7 window is the longest. The "client, not second authority" rule is the load-bearing anti-extraction mitigation and must be enforced at build time (B5-I4+).

Pass A dissent/uncertainty (verbatim-preserved): Sensor Fabric distinction is explicit (packet §0) and the candidate is quant-adjacent in subject matter only; the D2 clearance rests on parsing audit CSVs as inert data, which is sound, but the operator should note the subject matter for boundary hygiene at build time. Scope is the narrowest audience in the set (one artifact family).
